## 👋 About Me

I am a Front-End Engineer with strong experience in building complex, scalable, and maintainable web applications using **React, Angular, and TypeScript**.

Over the past years, I have worked on large commercial products and long-term enterprise platforms, including legacy system migrations, complex form-heavy applications, admin dashboards, and data-driven UI systems.

My core focus is on **clean architecture, performance optimization, stable UI behavior, and high-quality user experience**. I am comfortable working with legacy codebases, gradually modernizing them while ensuring backward compatibility and system stability.

Currently based in **Warsaw, Poland**.

## 📌 Important Note About GitHub Activity

During the last **~1.5 years**, my professional work has been split across **two GitHub accounts**, depending on the company/project context.

- **Current main account:**  
  👉 https://github.com/winniepuhh

- **Previous work account:**  
  👉 https://github.com/kyryloivanov17

This explains why activity may appear distributed or reduced on one account for certain periods. Most commercial work during this time was done under private or company-managed repositories.
